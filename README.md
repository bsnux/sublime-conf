# sublime-conf

My personal configuration for [Sublime Text 4](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

Updated to 4
Tested on macOS 11.6

## What's inside?

* Preferences.
* Keymapping.
* List of installed packages with *Package Control* (`cat User/Package\ Control.sublime-settings`)

## The User Package
**Packages/User** is a catch-all directory for custom plugins, snippets, macros, etc.
Consider it your personal area in the packages folder. *Sublime Text 3* will never
overwrite the contents of **Packages/User** during upgrades.


## Installation

1. Install **Sublime Text 3**

2. Clone this repo. We're assuming you're going to use your *home* directory.

3. Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

4. Link this directory to the default Sublime Text 4 config directory
